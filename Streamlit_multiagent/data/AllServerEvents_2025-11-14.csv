Microsoft Windows Server has detected that NTLM authentication is presently being used between clients and this server. This event occurs once per boot of the server on the first time a client uses NTLM with this server. NTLM is a weaker authentication mechanism. Please check:       Which applications are using NTLM authentication?      Are there configuration issues preventing the use of stronger authentication such as Kerberos authentication?      If NTLM must be supported is Extended Protection configured?

The Kerberos client received a KRB_AP_ERR_MODIFIED error from the server hc1dbsq36pv$. The target name used was HTTP/HC1DBSQ36Pv.thecarlylegroup.local. This indicates that the target server failed to decrypt the ticket provided by the client. This can occur when the target server principal name (SPN) is registered on an account other than the account the target service is using. Ensure that the target SPN is only registered on the account used by the server. This error can also happen if the target service account password is different than what is configured on the Kerberos Key Distribution Center for that target service. Ensure that the service on the server and the KDC are both configured to use the same password. If the server name is not fully qualified and the target domain (THECARLYLEGROUP.LOCAL) is different from the client domain (TCG.COM) check if there are identically named server accounts in these two domains or use the fully-qualified name to identify the server.,4,Microsoft-Windows-Security-Kerberos,System,HC1DBSQ36Pv,2025-11-14 17:13:58,System,Error,2025-11-14 09:37:48.460000000

The Kerberos client received a KRB_AP_ERR_MODIFIED error from the server weunpsolunsdw02$. The target name used was cifs/WEUNPSOLUNSDW02.NIBCPE.COM. This indicates that the target server failed to decrypt the ticket provided by the client. This can occur when the target server principal name (SPN) is registered on an account other than the account the target service is using. Ensure that the target SPN is only registered on the account used by the server. This error can also happen if the target service account password is different than what is configured on the Kerberos Key Distribution Center for that target service. Ensure that the service on the server and the KDC are both configured to use the same password. If the server name is not fully qualified and the target domain (THECARLYLEGROUP.LOCAL) is different from the client domain (THECARLYLEGROUP.LOCAL) check if there are identically named server accounts in these two domains or use the fully-qualified name to identify the server.,4,Microsoft-Windows-Security-Kerberos,System,HC1DBSQ90PV,2025-11-14 23:01:09,System,Error,2025-11-14 09:37:48.620000000
